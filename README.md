# Summary

This work aims to provide insights about unsupervised machine learning and how to interprete it. Unsupervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a dataset without explicit supervision. In other words, it deals with unlabeled data, and its goal is to discover patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without any predefined target variable or labels.  

In this work, `Kmeans model` was used and four clusters of penguins were discovered. Next,we used a machine learning interpretablility framework called `SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)` to explain how each feature in the dataset impact our model.
